I made this quick and dirty repo for readers of\
[The Reflectance Field Map: Mapping glass and specular surfaces in dynamic environments (Foster, Johnson, Kuipers ICRA 2023)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/research/pubs/Foster-icra-23.html).

Dear readers: we were supposed to have a clean repo by the end of summer, but life has gotten in the way. Since you may
need something
to reproduce the paper now, I decided to just dump the raw files we used for the paper figures and evaluation here. 
They are stock python3+jupyter+scipy except for some optional visualzation tools, so you should have no problem running them.

This fork is a temp hack until we update the main repo, so I'm just posting in the issue comment. The example script in the main repo is the core algorithm, but if you've read this far you probably want the high-powered ugly one here which has all the evaluation
and other goodies. 


**To use this repo, please run:**\
do_rfm_v2_headless.ipynb

**That script will want data that you can find at**
