I made this quick and dirty repo for readers of\
[The Reflectance Field Map: Mapping glass and specular surfaces in dynamic environments (Foster, Johnson, Kuipers ICRA 2023)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/research/pubs/Foster-icra-23.html).

We were supposed to have a clean repo by the end of summer, but life has gotten in the way. Since you need something
to reproduce the paper now, I decided to just dump the raw files we used for the paper figures and evaluation here. 
They are stock python3+jupyter+scipy except for some optional visualzation tools, so you should have no problem running them.

Collin and I both have jobs at autonomous vehicle companies, which is a very hard place to be right now, so (unsurprisingly!) I haven't
been able to get in touch with Collin to update the main repo, so I'm leaving this one in the issue comment. The example script in the 
main repo is the core algorithm, but if you've read this far you probably want the high-powered ugly one here which has all the evaluation
and other goodies. 


**To use this repo, please run:**\
do_rfm_v2_headless.ipynb

**That script will want data that you can find at**
